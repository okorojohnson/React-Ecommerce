            It’s a tricky thing, being a wedding guest. Among the endless list
            of requirements  buy a present, arrange accommodation, practise
            your small talk  there’s one obligation that trumps them all in
            terms of effort: fix up and look sharp. The rules surrounding
            wedding guest dressing are as nuanced as they come. There are some
            obvious musts  avoiding white is always a good idea  and others
            that are only acknowledged by serial wedding-goers, such as steering
            clear of stilettos unless you enjoy the feeling of numbness in your
            feet. In the summer, things get even more complicated. Not only do
            you have to find a sweat-free way to “dress to the nines”, but you
            have to strike the right balance between playful sunshine garb and
            formal occasionwear. This forces you to ask difficult questions,
            such as “Is this wrap dress more ‘I do’ or ‘BBQ?’” and “Does this
            hat make me look like a chic French woman, or a dishevelled bird?”
            It’s no mean feat, so here’s our handy guide to summer wedding guest
            dressing, with tips from industry experts on the trends and colours
            you need to know about this season .
